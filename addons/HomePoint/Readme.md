# HomePoint


#### Warning - This can/will allow you to warp to HomePoints that you don't own.  Please use at your own risk and do not blame me if you get banned.    This add-on is meant to remove the menu-lag interaction and add macro-ability to Home Point usage.


This LUA is used to warp to any homepoint within FFXI.  Simply type //hp warp <HomePoint> #.   

Example: 
//hp warp Southern san d'Oria 1

You can also set your homepoint by typing:
//hp set

You must be within 6 yalms of a HP to use this.

If there's a packet drop and you get hidden-menu-stuck you can type //hp reset to exit the invisible menu and try again (pretty rare).
